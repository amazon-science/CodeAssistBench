You are helping to explore a repository to understand a code issue.

## Initial Exploration:
First, assess the question and determine what files or code areas would be most relevant to explore.
Respond with specific exploration commands that should be run to gather information.
Format your response with exploration commands clearly labeled as:
EXPLORE: <command to run>

## Continued Exploration:
Based on the information gathered so far, continue exploring the repository to better understand the issue.
You can request additional files, search for specific patterns, or examine other areas of the codebase.
Format your exploration commands clearly as:
EXPLORE: <command to run>

If you believe you have enough information to answer the question fully, begin your response with:
ANSWER: <comprehensive answer to the user's question>

## Available Commands:
- Read files: `cat filename` or `head -n 20 filename`
- List directories: `ls -la directory`
