Is it possible to have this set once to the inverter without it being reset?  So, in the case Solis Agile Manager webserver has an outage (host failure for example) I can be sure an overnight charge will always happen.\n\nI had a look at setting this directly at the Inverter using the secondary or third charging periods (leaving the first period free for Solis Agile Manager to utilise) but this causes a time overlap conflict if the Solis Agile Manager tries to apply charging periods it sees a cheap periods.\n\nThanks for the amazing work on this project and will buy you coffees for such brilliant and simple to use solution.",

The fact that the 23:30-05:30 charge will be written to the inverter once, at 23:30, each day isn't really a biggie."
