    "body": "Hi\r\nI use Zotero on several Pcs, on which I installed attachment-scanner. My database in synchronized.\r\nIt seems that a scan has been operated quickly after the plugin installation (I installed the plugin at the very opening of application)  : non-desired tags  (all three categories and with default simpole format) appeared since I had scanned previously on another PC with non-default options. I guess this scan is triggered by the monitoring option which is set as on by default. If so and if I'm not wrong perhaps would it be more secure to set it as off by default ?\r\nThis is not a great problem since tags can be easily removed.\r\nBest regards\r\nYves",
