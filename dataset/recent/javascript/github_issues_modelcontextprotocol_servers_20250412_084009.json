I encountered the same \"Error: fetch is not defined\" problem on my mac.\r\n\r\nThe solution that worked for me was updating the Node version in the PATH environment variable in the claude_desktop_config.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"brave-search\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"-y\",\r\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"env\": {\r\n        \"BRAVE_API_KEY\": \"your-api-key\",\r\n        \"PATH\": \"/Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey points:\r\n1. Make sure to use a recent Node version (I updated from v16 to v20)\r\n2. Include the full PATH with all system directories\r\n3. Restart Claude Desktop after making these changes\r\n\r\nThis resolved the fetch not defined error and now the Brave search functionality works perfectly!"
