You can pass a list of operators to be blocked (if `enableInjectionProtection` is set to `true`):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"security\": {\r\n    \"enableInjectionProtection\": true\r\n  }\r\n  \"cmd\": {\r\n        \"enabled\": true,\r\n        \"command\": \"cmd.exe\",\r\n        \"args\": [\"/c\"],\r\n        \"blockedOperators\": [\"&\", \"|\", \";\", \"`\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if this doesn't solve the issue, otherwise I'll consider this solved and close.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Thanks for being my first issue! ðŸ¥‡ "
