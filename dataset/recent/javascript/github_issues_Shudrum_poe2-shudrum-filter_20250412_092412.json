    "body": "Thanks for a great filter. I noticed that rare and magic waystones are hidden. I tweaked your filter locally to add a line to show all rarities\r\n\r\n```\r\nShow\r\n  Class \"Waystone\"\r\n  AreaLevel == 82\r\n  Rarity <= Normal\r\n  WaystoneTier >= 16\r\n  PlayAlertSound 4 300\r\n  PlayEffect White\r\n  SetTextColor 200 200 200\r\n  SetBorderColor 74 68 58\r\n  SetBackgroundColor 74 68 58\r\n  SetFontSize 35\r\n  MinimapIcon 1 White Square\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was about to submit a pull request but noticed these are generated! Sorry I can't contribute to javascript, but I still wanted to report the issue",

In any case, rare waystones are not hidden, but this filter does not do any distinction between normal / magic and rare waystones because all are importants.\r\n\r\nThe only way the rare one was hidden may be because of the difference between the map tier and the current area level. Maybe the rare should always be displayed."
