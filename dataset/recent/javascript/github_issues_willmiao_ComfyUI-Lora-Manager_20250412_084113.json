After reviewing the implementation, it seems that the timeout is no longer necessary, so I’ve removed the related code. Everything is working fine so far. Thanks again for your PR—I really appreciate the effort to improve compatibility!"

The watchdog monitors additions and deletions within loras_root, but when files are moved manually, it only detects new additions—not deletions. Plus due to the unpredictable order of multiple file moves (e.g., the LoRA file moving before its metadata file), cache inconsistencies or even metadata loss may occur.\n\nIf I have time, I’ll look into a more sophisticated solution to handle this better. For now, I recommend using the bulk operation feature in LoRA Manager to move files within the interface safely.\n\nThat said, I've submitted a fix that will attempt to correct incorrect file paths when rebuilding the cache on startup. If you're experiencing issues where metadata errors prevent LoRAs from loading, please try restarting ComfyUI and see if that resolves the problem.\n\nAlso, LoRA Stack is already supported in v0.7.36, and checkpoint management is planned for a future update."
