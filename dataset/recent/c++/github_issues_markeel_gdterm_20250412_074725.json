        "body": "I took a look at the change and I think this is on the right path, but what other terminals do is set a config option for this kind of behavior or react to an escape code being sent.  The libtmt library only did things that matches what an ANSI term type would do, but I have since extended that because it was inadequate for MS windows.  If emacs sends an escape code to have an escape sent for meta, ten I'd prefer to react to that.  Btw were you using emacs on Linux or Windows?"

The change I made was based on how to resolve the same issue when using XTerm by setting:\r\n\r\n XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since pushing that change I have also determined CTRL doesn't quite fully work either. C-/ ended up writing the / character instead of performing the action for the keybinding.\r\n\r\nOh, and I am using Linux."

        "body": "I'm not sure there is really any downside to how you made the change since I'm not sure when or why you might accidentally send an escape by just pressing the alt or meta keys, but since xterm made it configurable I'm leaning to adding that to the GDTerm settings.\r\n\r\nBTW the Ctrl-/ is broken and I'll add an issue.  The range in the Godot key didn't match for the characters '/' and '~' so that's why that's not working.\r\n\r\nI'm not really an emacs user, but I loaded it onto my system and will do a few tests as well."

Not sure why.  It may be that emacs did some things that weren't quite compatible with a terminal as primitive as TERM=ansi.\r\n\r\n"
