    "body": "Hello! Firstly, this library looks extremely promising, would solve a very big issue I was dealing with!\n\nI had a look at the `blocking_send_recv_example.py` to see how I could potentially send over a tensor.\nThis test doesn't seem to work, it misuses `zmq`, as both procs are doing `connect`, while the correct usage is for the target proc to use `.bind` and the initiator proc to use `.connect`. The string literal for the addr in `.connect` is also wrong as there are a few extra spaces.\n\nAfter fixing a few of these issues myself, I am getting the following error from the initiator:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/mnt/large_shared/libs/nixl/test/python/blocking_send_recv_example.py\", line 93, in <module>\n    xfer_handle = agent.initialize_xfer(\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/mnt/large_shared/users/federico/env_nightly/lib/python3.11/site-packages/nixl/_api.py\", line 299, in initialize_xfer\n    handle = self.agent.createXferReq(\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nTypeError: createXferReq(): incompatible function arguments.

        "body": "Hello and thanks for pointing this out. We have fixed it in PR #65 and it's already merged. We further added data checks and some clean ups to the code.\n \nOne point to consider is that two sided and blocking is not our targeted mode of operation, this was an example to give an idea of how it's possible to replicate 2-sided with 1-sided. (Since it was an example to demonstrate the idea, it was supposed to be in our examples directory, and we plan to add CIs for examples directory very soon to avoid these issues). You can still pass tensors to 1-sided operations too, it's the same API."
