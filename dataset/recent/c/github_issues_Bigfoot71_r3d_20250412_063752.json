Here is an example of the output from the basic example with it being the same for my own built.\n\n```\nINFO: SHADER: [ID 4] Vertex shader compiled successfully\nINFO: SHADER: [ID 5] Fragment shader compiled successfully\nWARNING: SHADER: [ID 6] Failed to link shader program\nWARNING: SHADER: [ID 6] Link error: ERROR: Linking vertex stage: Missing entry point: Each stage requires one entry point\nERROR: Linking fragment stage: Missing entry point: Each stage requires one entry point\n\nWARNING: SHADER: Failed to load custom shader code, using default shader\nINFO: SHADER: [ID 4] Vertex shader compiled successfully\nINFO: SHADER: [ID 5] Fragment shader compiled successfully\nWARNING: SHADER: [ID 6] Failed to link shader program\nWARNING: SHADER: [ID 6] Link error: ERROR: Linking vertex stage: Missing entry point: Each stage requires one entry point\nERROR: Linking fragment stage: Missing entry point: Each stage requires one entry point\n\nWARNING: SHADER: Failed to load custom shader code, using default shader\n```\n\nBuilding on windows using cmake and Mingw. Only special flags for cmake differing from the build instrcutions are `-G \"MinGW Makefiles\" -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python`. As it would seem that when building it was looking for python3 while I do indeed have python 3.12 the naming was different.",
