    "body": "I'm running into issues getting the MCP setup on Mac. \n\n1. The original venv / setup kept referencing .exe files and failing to set up the virtual environment. \n2. I made some updates to make it run on Mac -- I can launch the virtual environment. When putting my MCP code into Cursor (it's the venv python file then a space then the path to the py file) it says no tools. Any help for mac users would be great. ",

Looks very similar to the approach for #20 which I will be merging soon to resolve this."
