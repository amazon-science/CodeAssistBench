Given that .windsurfrules has character limitations, I was exploring if we can shift your rules to \"Global Rules\" section in windsurf without creating any negative impact. Hope it's clearer now.\n\n"

        "body": "Yeah the info is helpful! I think the answer is, it depends. I think moving the rules to the \"Global Rules\" section is a good idea that would work for your project. I don't see any issues for your specific project for now. The issue is that these instructions will impact all your projects since anything in the global rules section affects the entire Windsurf. If your intention is to have these Windsurf rules apply to every project, that's perfectly fine. However, if you only want these additional Windsurf rules from my repo to affect certain projects, it could cause side effects.\n\nOne alternative is to rename the Windsurf rules in my repository to another name and manually include it (using mention) when launching new cascade requests. You likely won't need to do this often because, once you include the file in the initial cascade conversation, Windsurf keeps it in the context. This could be a useful workaround."
