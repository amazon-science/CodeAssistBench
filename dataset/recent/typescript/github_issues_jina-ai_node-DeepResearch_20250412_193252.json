Background\\\\n\\\\nThe Halo and Destiny series, both developed by Bungie (with Destiny later developed by Bungie independently), are renowned for their sophisticated enemy AI. The AI systems in these games are designed not merely to present a challenge but to create engaging and believable combat encounters. A core design philosophy revolves around the concept of \\\\\\\"30 seconds of fun,\\\\\\\" where each encounter should offer distinct phases of engagement, planning, and execution, each with associated pleasures and rewards.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Design Details\\\\n\\\\n#### 2.1. Halo AI Design\\\\n\\\\n*   **Territoriality:** Halo's AI emphasizes territorial control. Enemies are assigned territories, and their behavior is dictated by their need to defend or expand these zones. This design is closely tied to the player's recharging shield mechanic, providing safe zones and a sense of progress as the player advances.\\\\n*   **Limited Knowledge Model:** To simulate realistic combat, Halo's AI operates with a limited knowledge model. Enemies do not have perfect awareness of the player's location at all times, allowing for stealth and flanking maneuvers. AI misperception, where enemies assume the player is still where they last saw them, adds depth to the gameplay.\\\\n*   **Satisfying Enemies:** Enemies are designed to be cunning, formidable, and tactical. They react to the player's presence, making the player feel important, and their actions reflect the impact of the player's choices. Enemies possess capabilities roughly equivalent to the player, including the ability to use vehicles and weapons.\\\\n\\\\n#### 2.2. Destiny AI Design\\\\n\\\\nWhile specific technical details of Destiny's AI are less readily available, the game's AI shares similarities with Halo, emphasizing challenging and varied enemy behaviors. Destiny features a range of adversaries, each with unique behaviors, attack patterns, and decision-making algorithms. The Taken faction is often cited as having more complex and engaging AI compared to other enemy types.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Algorithmic Principles\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1. Perception and Memory\\\\n\\\\n*   **Simulated Senses:** AI characters perceive the game world through simulated senses, primarily vision and hearing. This mirrors the player's sensory experience, allowing players to anticipate AI behavior based on their own understanding of the environment.\\\\n*   **Memory Structures:** The AI maintains memory structures to track observed entities and events. This memory is not perfect; it decays over time and is subject to misinterpretation, contributing to the AI's realistic behavior.\\\\n*   **Combat Information Processing:** Raw sensory data is processed into higher-level combat information, such as identifying enemies, assessing threats, and determining the state of battle.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2. Decision Making\\\\n\\\\n*   **Hierarchical Behavior Trees:** The AI's decision-making process is often structured using hierarchical behavior trees. These trees define the AI's possible states (e.g., idle, guard/patrol, attack/defend, retreat) and the conditions that trigger transitions between them.\\\\n*   **Goal-Oriented Behavior:** AI behavior is goal-oriented, with the AI constantly evaluating its situation and selecting actions that best achieve its current goals. This includes selecting advantageous positions, coordinating with allies, and adapting to changes in the environment.\\\\n*   **Predictable Actions, Unpredictable Consequences:** The AI aims for predictable actions to allow players to develop strategies, but the consequences of those actions are less predictable, contributing to replayability.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.3. Pathfinding\\\\n\\\\n*   **Navigation Meshes:** AI characters navigate the game world using navigation meshes (navmeshes), which are precomputed representations of the traversable areas in a level. The AI uses pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*) to find the shortest or most efficient path to a desired location on the navmesh.\\\\n*   **Object Awareness:** The AI is aware of objects in the environment and their properties (e.g., size, traversability). This allows the AI to make informed decisions about how to navigate around or interact with objects.\\\\n*   **Animation Integration:** Animation is used to smooth out the look of pathfinding, making the AI's movements appear more natural and fluid. Object tags are used to identify interactive elements, such as cover points or climbable objects.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.4.
