    "body": "**Issue**: When installing the package as a vendored dependency, the following export is missing in `vendored/daydreams/src/index.ts`:\n\n```ts\nexport * from \"./extensions\";\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior  \nThe package should properly export everything from `./extensions` so that it can be used when vendored.  \n\n## Steps to Reproduce  \n1. Install `daydreams` as a vendored dependency.  \n2. Attempt to use anything from `./extensions`.  \n3. Observe that the module is not exported.  \n\nWould it be possible to add this export to the package? Thanks!",
