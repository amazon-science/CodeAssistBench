    "body": "**Description:**\nWhen connecting to the Playwright MCP server, I encountered a `428 Precondition Required` error due to a version mismatch between the server and client:\n\n**Error details:**\n```\nError: browserType.connect: WebSocket error: ws://localhost:59985/ 428 Precondition Required\n╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n║ Playwright version mismatch:                       ║\n║   - server version: v1.51                          ║\n║   - client version: v1.52                          ║\n║                                                    ║\n║ If you are using VSCode extension, restart VSCode. ║\n║                                                    ║\n║ If you are connecting to a remote service,         ║\n║ keep your local Playwright version in sync         ║\n║ with the remote service version.                   ║\n║                                                    ║\n║ <3 Playwright Team                                 ║\n╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n```\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Start Playwright server using:\n   ```\n   npx playwright@latest run-server\n   ```\n   Output:\n   ```\n   Listening on ws://localhost:59985/\n   ```\n\n2. Configure MCP client with the following:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"playwright\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"@playwright/mcp@latest\"],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"PLAYWRIGHT_WS_ENDPOINT\": \"ws://localhost:59985/\"\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Attempt connection; observe the version mismatch error.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nSuccessful connection without version mismatch error.\n\n**Workaround Attempted:**\nPinning both server and client explicitly to the same version (`v1.51` or `v1.52`) does **not** resolve the issue.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Playwright MCP client version: `v1.52`\n- Playwright server version: `v1.51`\n- OS/environment details (optional): [Add if relevant]\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\nInvestigate internal compatibility handling or provide explicit documentation on resolving server-client mismatches beyond simple version pinning.\n\nThank you!\n\n",
