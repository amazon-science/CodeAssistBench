How to set some parameters during training, such as the `learning rate scheduler` and `cfg scale`?\n3. Are the sampler and denoiser in the code useful? As far as I understand, if flow matching is used for training, these two modules should not be used?\n4. In the code, when solving the integral, inference uses `rk4` instead of `euler`. Do these two have a big impact on the result video?\n5. In the pre-training 1 and 2 stages, is the `add noise range` for training images and training videos 600-900?

The parameter `num_noise_interval` was ultimately not used. It was originally intended to encode a latent input once and sample multiple noise timesteps $t$ to accelerate training.

The learning rate scheduler is kept constant throughout training.\n\n3. Both the sampler and denoiser components are not used in the implementation.  \n\n4. There was a misunderstanding regarding the numerical method employed. The actual method passed and used is Euler, not default `rk4`, you can check this in the inference code.\n\n5. The range of `img_ref_noise_step_range` is set to \\[100, 300\\] in the implementation, based on empirical observations. However, we are not certain if this range is optimal, as ablation studies could not be conducted due to computational limitations and time constraints.  \n\nIf you have any questions or require adaptations of our algorithm to suit your specific problem, I am more than happy to share insights and experiences from this project with you :)"}, {"user": "frozoul", "created_at": "2025-03-04T12:30:18Z", "body": "Thank you for your reply.

Run `where npx` in your terminal (I think it should be C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npx.cmd or\nC:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\npx.cmd)\n2.

**Training:**  \n   The model was trained using the following bash command:\n   ```bash\n   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3,7,6,5,4,2,1,0 accelerate launch train_single.py \\\n    --pretrained_model_name_or_path=\"path/checkpoints/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt\" \\\n    --finetune_mode=True \\\n    --posenet_model_finetune_path=\"path/checkpoints/Animation/pose_net.pth\" \\\n    --face_encoder_finetune_path=\"path/checkpoints/Animation/face_encoder.pth\" \\\n    --unet_model_finetune_path=\"path/checkpoints/Animation/unet.pth\" \\\n

**Loading:**  \n   After training, I attempted to load the model with the following code:\n   ```python\n   unet_state_dict = torch.load(args.unet_model_name_or_path, map_location=\"cpu\")\n   unet.load_state_dict(unet_state_dict, strict=True)\n   ```\n   This resulted in the error shown above.\n\n**Environment:**  \n- **Python:** 3.12.3\n- **PyTorch:** 2.5.1+cu124 \n- **Diffusers:** 0.32.1\n\n**Additional Context:**  \n- The error lists several missing keys in the state dict (e.g., `\"down_blocks.0.attentions.0.transformer_blocks.0.attn2.processor.id_to_k.weight\"`, etc.).\n- This issue may indicate a mismatch between the model architecture used during training and the one expected during inference.  \n- Has there been any recent change in the model structure or naming conventions that could lead to this issue?\n\nAny help or guidance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.", "comments_url":

Change the reload method to `:replace`, since this will also reload the `<head>` if there are changes\r\n2. Add the `scss` extension and paths to the **html_paths** and **html_extensions**, which will then trigger an `:replace` reload if a `scss` file is changed\r\n\r\nThis will not do a fine-grained css reload, but a full Turbo visit instead, but maybe this is good enough for your use case."}, {"user": "rogerkk", "created_at": "2025-01-08T14:16:16Z", "body": "Ah, nice to know about an alternative approach.

However, as mentioned in the README, when **scaling is enabled**, the gizmo *requires* local orientation, so it automatically switches to **local** mode in those cases.\n\nThat's why when you use:\n```cpp\nGIZMO_ROTATE | GIZMO_SCALE\n```\nit behaves as expected because local mode is active. But without the scale component, it stays in global mode by default, and rotation won‚Äôt apply as you‚Äôd expect.
